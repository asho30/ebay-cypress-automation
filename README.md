# eBay Search Automation with Cypress

## Overview
This project automates the following user flow on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com) using Cypress with the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern:

1. Navigate to `https://www.ebay.com/`
2. Validate that you have landed on the main page.
3. Search for `mazda mx-5`.
4. Validate the results obtained.
5. Print/log the number of obtained search results.
6. From the left-hand side filter, select **Transmission â†’ Manual**.
7. Validate that results are filtered accordingly.

The project reads test data from an **external JSON file**, supports **custom commands**, and generates an **HTML report**.

## Prerequisites

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asho30/ebay-cypress-automation.git
cd <your-project-folder>  (i.e. D:\ebay_cypress)

## Running Tests

### Open Cypress UI:
```bash
npx cypress open
```

### Run in Headless Mode with Report:
```bash
npx cypress run
```

---

## Test Data
Test data is stored in `cypress/fixtures/testData.json`:
```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://www.ebay.com",
  "searchTerm": "mazda mx-5",
  "filter": {
    "transmission": "Manual"
  }
}
```

You can easily change values here without modifying test code.

## Reports
This project uses **cypress-mochawesome-reporter** to generate HTML reports.

### To view the report:
1. After running tests in headless mode, merge JSON reports:
```bash
npx mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/*.json > report.json
```
2. Generate HTML report:
```bash
npx mochawesome-report-generator report.json
```
3. Open `mochawesome-report/report.html` in your browser.
